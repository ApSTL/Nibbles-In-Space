# Nibbles In Space
Small tools, or apps, typically single-page applications, SPA, for use in a browser to easily illustrate basic concepts.
 
Currently only one SPA is in public release, the Orbit Visualiser, which can be viewed at [AppliedSpace.Tech](https://www.appliedspace.tech/nibbles-in-space-orbit-visualiser/). This SPA is documented at [Detailed Design Report Orbit Visualiser.pdf](https://github.com/ApSTL/Nibbles-In-Space/blob/main/Detailed%20Design%20Report%20Orbit%20Visualiser.pdf).
